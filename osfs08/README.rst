Step 08: IPC
````````````

Orange'S is designed as a microkernel-based system.
You'll see in ``a/`` how IPC (Inter-Process Communication) is implemented.
It is very similar to the IPC mechanism in Minix, since Orange'S is inspired by Minix.

After you read my code, it'll be very easy for you to understand Minix and other microkernel IPC mechanisms.
